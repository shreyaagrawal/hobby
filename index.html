        <p>My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story.<br /><br />I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my favourite author, J.K.Rowling who writes “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.

            I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very challenging.
